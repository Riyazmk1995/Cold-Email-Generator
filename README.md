# Cold-Email-Generator

This project is a Cold Email Generator designed for service-based companies, leveraging GROQ, LangChain, and Streamlit. The application streamlines the process of reaching out to potential clients by crafting personalized cold emails based on job opportunities available on a company's careers page. By simply providing a URL, the tool scrapes job listings, matches them with relevant portfolio links sourced from a vector database, and composes tailored emails.

# Key Features
1. Automated Job Scraping: Users can input the URL of any company's careers page, and the system will extract current job postings.
2. Personalized Email Generation: Generates customized cold emails targeted at each job listing, integrating relevant project links from the company's portfolio.
3. AI-Driven Matching: Utilizes advanced AI algorithms to match job descriptions with the most suitable portfolio projects from the vector database.

# Real-Life Use Case
Imagine that a renowned sportswear company, say Nike, is looking for a Principal Software Engineer and is deep into its recruitment process, investing in advertising, interviews, onboarding, and training. Meanwhile, a software development company like XYZ offers a cost-effective solution by providing an experienced software engineer on a contract basis.

To introduce this solution, Samson, a business development executive from XYZ, uses this Cold Email Generator. By simply entering Nike's careers page URL, Samson can quickly generate a personalized email showcasing XYZ's expertise and portfolio that matches Nike's requirements, saving time and effort in crafting the outreach manually.
